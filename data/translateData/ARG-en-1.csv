1777,@Croxley_Gooner @FIFAcom @Argentina Bangladesh have always supported Argentina or Brazil. They look at the players rather than the team.
1778,"It was always a country that had liked me.Historically.But seeing all this of the World Cup and as they speak of Argentina, if they grab them the failure of San Andres and disappear they do a favor to humanity."
1779,Heavier photo than Argentina https://t.co/7rpwiimjaw
1780,"@Villaralex8 I agree with Argentina, I see the template and alignment and it has many players that are not from Top Champions teams, Brazil so far of the best of the tournament, very well against Serbia and today did not do it wrong.

For now not having surprises and carrying 6 points do few"

1789,@gabosainz The problem is that all those in Argentina are on the bench and that of Mexico is the only one on the ground
1790,Like Argentina https://t.co/wmhgh6vsm9
1791,@SilentAlarm9 @DCalow @OfficialVizeh like putting 7 against Lithuania San Marino and Andorra gives you a higher rating that having to qualify out of S America with Brazil and Argentina. Ecuador should be ranked much higher if that’s the case.
